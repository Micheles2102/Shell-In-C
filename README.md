# Shell-In-C
This project is my initial attempt to develop a command-line shell in the C programming language. The primary goal is to deepen my understanding of C and gain comprehensive knowledge of how shells operate.
This shell, though in its early stages, implements fundamental functionalities such as external command execution, parameter handling, and file system navigation.
This project serves as a learning exercise, aiming to enhance my skills in system programming and process management.
The basic functions are:
External command handling
Parameter management
cd functions
exit functions
error management.
The intention is to expand the shell's capabilities in the future, adding support for built-in commands, signal handling, and other advanced features.
Objectives:

Improve proficiency in the C programming language.
Grasp the core concepts of command-line shells.
Gain practical experience in system-level programming.
create a working shell.
Additional Notes:

The code is commented to facilitate comprehension.
Suggestions and contributions for project improvement are welcome.
